In a landmark policy shift, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has approved the creation of a Regional Agribusiness Trade Corridor to facilitate the free movement of agricultural goods, technologies, and services between member countries.

This corridor will reduce trade barriers, improve infrastructure at border posts, and harmonize phytosanitary standards for fresh produce and livestock. The plan includes the construction of 14 cross-border agribusiness parks equipped with cold storage, warehousing, quality control labs, and customs clearance hubs.

ABNEG is engaging national agribusiness associations to ensure that smallholders and cooperatives are included in this transformative trade framework. According to ECOWAS Trade Commissioner, Hamed Sory, *‚ÄúThis is about more than trade. It‚Äôs about building a regional food economy that works for everyone.‚Äù*

## üöÄ 2. Kenyan Youth Launch Drone Startup to Fight Post-Harvest Losses

Three university graduates in Kenya have launched a drone startup, AgroSky, that is helping smallholder farmers reduce post-harvest losses by providing aerial surveillance, pest detection, and logistics mapping services.

AgroSky drones are equipped with multispectral imaging cameras that detect early signs of fungal infection, pest infestation, and nitrogen deficiency. This data is sent to a mobile app that provides farmers with real-time actionable insights. The startup also offers a ‚ÄúLast Mile‚Äù mapping tool that helps cooperatives coordinate transport during harvest.

Within six months of operations, AgroSky has signed contracts with 15 farming cooperatives and received seed funding from a Dutch-Africa agritech innovation fund. ABNEG is onboarding AgroSky into its Agritech Mentorship Circle to scale their reach beyond East Africa.

ABNEG has officially launched its **Market Access Accelerator (MAA)**‚Äîa new program designed to support agribusinesses in Africa and the diaspora to access high-value export markets. The accelerator will provide training, compliance audits, packaging redesign, digital marketing support, and direct matchmaking with foreign buyers.

**Program Highlights:**
- 10-week online bootcamp focused on export standards (EU, UK, USA, UAE)
- Access to export readiness scorecards and compliance checklists
- Partnerships with export logistics companies and trade attach√©s
- Cohorts for fresh produce, processed foods, herbal teas, spices, and shea-based cosmetics

The first cohort includes 30 agribusinesses from 12 African countries. One participant, Kwame Doku of Savanna Fruits Ghana, shared: *‚ÄúBefore this program, I didn‚Äôt know where to start. Now I have an export plan, a new label, and a buyer in Dubai.‚Äù*

MAA will run twice per year and is free for verified ABNEG members. Applications for the November 2025 cohort will open in August.

## üåø 4. Scientists Develop Climate-Resilient Maize for Sahel Region

**Date:** April 21, 2025

A team of agricultural scientists working with the West Africa Agricultural Research Consortium (WAARC) has successfully developed a new strain of climate-resilient maize designed specifically for arid and semi-arid zones of the Sahel.

Dubbed ‚ÄúSahelMax 23‚Äù, the maize variety is drought-tolerant, matures 30% faster than conventional varieties, and demonstrates strong resistance to pests and soil salinity. The new variety was field-tested in Burkina Faso, Mali, and northern Ghana with over 7,000 farmers participating in pilot programs.

According to Dr. Mariama Toure, lead breeder at WAARC, ‚ÄúSahelMax 23 is not just a new crop‚Äîit‚Äôs a new chapter in food security. This is what African science can achieve when fully funded and locally driven.‚Äù

The breakthrough comes at a critical time as climate change continues to disrupt planting seasons, reduce yields, and worsen food insecurity across the Sahel. ABNEG is coordinating a knowledge transfer series to help farmers adopt SahelMax 23 and improve resilience through regenerative soil practices and community seed banks.

The seed will be available commercially across the region by early 2026. ABNEG will prioritize distribution to women-led cooperatives and youth-run farms.
