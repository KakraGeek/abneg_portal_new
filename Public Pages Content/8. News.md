In a bold move to modernize its agriculture sector, Ghana has launched a $100 million National Smart Farming Initiative to boost productivity, resilience, and income for smallholder farmers. The program integrates cutting-edge digital tools including drone-assisted planting, real-time soil moisture sensors, satellite crop monitoring, AI-based pest detection, and weather forecasting apps.

The Minister of Agriculture, Hon. Kwesi Armah, stated during the launch that the program will reach over 250,000 farmers in its first year. It includes subsidies for smart irrigation systems, free farmer training modules in six languages, and mobile-based extension services to provide on-demand agronomic advice.

ABNEG has been invited as a key stakeholder to support grassroots training and provide mentorship for agritech entrepreneurs through its Smart Farms Accelerator. The platform will also connect participating farmers to buyers and logistics providers via the ABNEG Marketplace.

‚ÄúThis program represents a pivotal shift for Ghana‚Äôs food systems,‚Äù said ABNEG‚Äôs President, Nana Kwaku Aboagye. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an opportunity to close the digital divide and empower smallholder farmers with the tools of the future.‚Äù

ABNEG is proud to celebrate one of its founding members, Ms. Linda Abena Boateng, who has won the 2025 African Agripreneur Award presented by the African Development Bank. Her company, Green Harvest Ghana, was recognized for transforming cassava farming into a thriving export industry through the production of gluten-free, high-quality cassava flour.

Linda's innovation has led to the creation of over 120 full-time jobs‚Äî70% of which are held by women‚Äîand the onboarding of 2,000 cassava outgrowers across Eastern and Central Ghana. By building solar-powered mini-processing hubs in rural communities, her company has drastically reduced post-harvest losses and improved income levels for smallholder farmers.

Her award-winning initiative is not just about commerce but impact. Through her Women in Agribusiness Fellowship, Linda mentors young female entrepreneurs, shares her business model in schools and community centers, and advocates for inclusive agribusiness policies across the continent.

In her acceptance speech, she remarked, ‚ÄúThis award is for every woman who dared to dream and till the soil, who built something from the ground up. We are changing the narrative of African agriculture‚Äîone harvest at a time.‚Äù

New findings from ABNEG‚Äôs Diaspora Investment Watch show a record-setting 40% increase in AgriTech investments by Africans in the diaspora during Q1 2025. The $320 million influx has primarily gone to startups offering digital solutions for African agriculture‚Äîranging from farm management platforms and soil analysis apps to blockchain-based traceability systems.

Diaspora investors, mostly from the US, UK, and Canada, cited social impact, scalable returns, and technology transfer as the top motivators. Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, and Ethiopia emerged as hotspots for investment-ready innovations. Notable deals include a $10M round raised by FarmFleet for its logistics-as-a-service platform and a $5M diaspora fund for youth-led agritech incubators in Ghana.

To build on this momentum, ABNEG is organizing a virtual matchmaking summit in October 2025 where diaspora investors can meet vetted startups and cooperatives seeking capital and strategic guidance.

‚ÄúInvestment from the diaspora is not just financial‚Äîit brings networks, experience, and confidence,‚Äù said ABNEG Diaspora Director, Fatou Diallo. ‚ÄúWe are building bridges between opportunity and heritage.‚Äù

In a landmark announcement for organic agriculture, the African Centre for Crop Research (ACCR) has approved a new biopesticide, BioShield-X, developed from neem oil and chili extract. This natural solution has proven effective against key pests like aphids, armyworms, and whiteflies, while remaining harmless to pollinators and safe for food crops.

BioShield-X was trialed across demonstration farms in Ghana, Togo, and C√¥te d'Ivoire, with results showing over 85% pest control efficiency and a 20% increase in yield among test plots compared to untreated fields. Farmers praised the product for its affordability, ease of use, and the absence of harmful chemical residues.

The product is now certified for organic farming across six West African countries, and ABNEG has secured exclusive training rights to introduce BioShield-X to its member communities through a regional awareness campaign.

In August, ABNEG will host live webinars and in-person demos to train members on proper usage, integrated pest management, and natural farming alternatives. Farmers and cooperatives are encouraged to register via the ABNEG Training Portal.

Dr. Sena Akoto, lead researcher at ACCR, stated, ‚ÄúThis is a home-grown solution for Africa‚Äôs food security challenges‚Äîeco-safe, cost-effective, and scalable.‚Äù
